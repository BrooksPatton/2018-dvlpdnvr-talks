## Slides and Other Resources

* Quick summary

We Talked about the industry can get better at bringing on new talent
Themes were clear.
    * Don't underestimate juniors - giving them real tasks with real feedback helps them grow, consider QA/Support Desk as a starting point
    * Mentorship is part of the job - give juniors a *specific* person that is meant to teach and grow their skills
    * This is good for the business - hiring seniors is hard and teaching is fun, so do it! their might also be huge tax breaks involved?
