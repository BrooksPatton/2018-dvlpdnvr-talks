## Slides and Other Resources

* Quick summary

We Talked about how technical people (whatever that means) can do more to help the world using their (our) awesome skills!!
Themes were clear.
    * Empathy before code - listen and understand the problem before diving into a project.
    * Data matters - a lot of great organizations dont have the resources to record and measure their results
    * Donate as a partner - have your organization or friends donate time *and* money *and* other things to a specific org you feel attached to.

* Panelist bios and contact info
